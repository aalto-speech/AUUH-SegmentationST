AUUH_A:
  - Trafo-C-long
  - multiling (eng,ces,mon) (word+sentence)
  - morfessor baseline

AUUH_B:
  - Trafo-C-long
  - multiling (eng,ces,mon) (word+sentence)
  - NOTE: word level models were finetuned on word only data (without word-task symbol)
    This was just an accident - but it makes comparisons with AUUH_A word tasks a little off
    - fixed this for the paper!

AUUH_C:
  - BLSTM-A-long  [NOTE: long vs non-long is just a matter of max input length]
    - Note: for CES and MON we used BLSTM-A-long-morevalid (which just runs validation more often)
  - monoling (word+sentence)
  - morfessor

AUUH_D:
  - BLSTM-A-long
    - Note: for CES and MON we used BLSTM-A-long-morevalid (which just runs validation more often)
  - monoling (word+sentence)

AUUH_E:
  - BLSTM-A
  - monoling (word)
  - morfessor

AUUH_F:
  - BLSTM-A
  - monoling (word)
